  "TermsSec14_c": "(c) Informal Dispute Resolution. We want to address your concerns without needing a formal legal case. Before filing a claim against WellMe, you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting us via email to help@thewellnessmethod.com or at our mailing address at WellMe, ATTN: Legal, 2417 Michigan Avenue, Santa Monica, CA 90404, and providing us with your email address. We'll try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting you through email. If a dispute is not resolved within 30 days after submission, you or WellMe may bring a formal proceeding subject to these Terms.",
  "TermsSec14_d": "(d) Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. You and WellMe agree that all disputes arising out of, relating to, or in connection with these Terms or your use of the Products and Services, including claims related to privacy or data security, will be resolved through binding arbitration on an individual basis, except that you and WellMe retain the right: (1) to bring an individual action informally (as provided in section c above) or in small claims court, or (2) seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, or patents. All submissions to the arbitrator, the proceedings, and the award shall be confidential, except as may lawfully be required in judicial proceedings relating to the arbitration or as otherwise required by law.",
  "TermsSec14_e": "(e) Arbitration Rules. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this dispute-resolution provision. Arbitration will be initiated through the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"). If the AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. The then-current version of the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules (“AAA Rules”) will govern the arbitration, except to the extent those rules conflict with these Terms. The AAA Rules are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitration will be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator. If the claim is for $10,000 or less, the party initiating the arbitration may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing; or (3) by an in person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county of your billing address. In the case of an in-person hearing, the proceedings will be conducted at a location which is reasonably convenient for both parties with due consideration of the ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination will be made by the arbitration institution. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation will be limited to those fees set forth in the AAA Rules with the remainder paid by WellMe. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the arbitration is frivolous, unreasonable, groundless or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse WellMe for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator will issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.",
  "TermsSec14_f": "(f) Authority of Arbitrator. The arbitrator will have exclusive authority to decide the jurisdiction of the arbitrator, including any unconscionability challenge or other challenge that the arbitration provision or the Agreement is void, voidable, or otherwise invalid. The arbitrator will also have the exclusive authority to determine the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and WellMe. The dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim or dispute. The arbitrator will have the authority to award all remedies available under Applicable Law, the arbitral forum's rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and WellMe.",
  "TermsSec14_g": "(g) Additional Procedures for Mass Arbitrations. These Additional Procedures for Mass Arbitrations (in addition to the other provisions of this arbitration provision and the applicable AAA Rules) shall apply if twenty-five (25) or more similar disputes are asserted against WellMe or against you by the same or coordinated counsel or are otherwise coordinated (collectively \"Mass Arbitration\"). These Additional Procedures for Mass Arbitrations are designed to lead to the streamlined and cost-effective resolution of claims and to ensure that large volume filings do not impose unnecessary burdens or impediments to the resolution and cost-effective adjudication of similar claims. They are not intended to delay or deny access to arbitration. You understand, acknowledge, and agree that Mass Arbitrations may delay resolution of your dispute. The parties agree that as part of initiating a Mass Arbitration, their counsel shall meet and confer in good faith in an effort to resolve the disputes, streamline procedures, address the exchange of information, modify the number of Disputes to be adjudicated, and conserve the parties' and the AAA's resources. If at least one hundred (100) disputes are submitted as part of the Mass Arbitration, counsel for each party shall each select fifty (50) disputes to be filed, assigned to different arbitrators (no arbitrator shall shall be assigned more than 3 disputes) and to proceed as cases in individual arbitrations. If a case is withdrawn before the issuance of an arbitration award, another claim shall be selected to proceed as part of this process. The remaining disputes shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed or collected in connection with those claims. After this initial set of proceedings, counsel for the parties shall participate in a global mediation session with a retired federal or state court judge jointly selected by counsel in an effort to resolve the remaining disputes, and WellMe shall pay the mediator's fee. If counsel cannot agree on a mediator, one will be selected by the Arbitrator. If at the end of the process described in the immediately preceding paragraph, twenty five (25) or more similar disputes have not been resolved, then the remaining disputes shall be arbitrated subject to the AAA Supplementary Rules for Multiple Case Filings and the AAA Multiple Consumer Case Filing Fee Schedule. If fewer than twenty-five (25) disputes remain, the remaining disputes shall proceed individually.",
  "TermsSec14_h": "(h) Enforceability.
